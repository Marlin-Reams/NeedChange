# baskets = ["oranges","apples","books"]

# # for item in baskets:
# #     print(item + ' party')

# students =["jeff","curtis","karen","trust","nicolette","ally"]

# # for student in students:
# #     print(student + " party")

# # problem ^^^ I have to re write loops for specific lists

# # solution is to create a function that does the party thing to any list



# def party(any_list):   #any list is my parameter
#     for item in any_list:
#         print(item + " party")
# party()
