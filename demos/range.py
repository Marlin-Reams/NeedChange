# Python Ranges

# python ranges are a sequence type like lists
# range represents an immutable sequence of numbers
# commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops
# range without a starting point will default to zero
# you can give range 3 arugments, a start, stop, and step
# e.g. for num in range (2, 10, 2)
# you would return 2 4 6 8

# for num in range(2, 10, 2):
#     print(num)


# range also can be used to create lists and tuples

# my_list = list(range(10))
# print(my_list)

# create a list of odd numbers ranging from 3 - 99

# odd_list = list(range(3,100,2))
# print(odd_list)


#ranges - negative step
#will go back from the start point cuz the begging is 5 and the end is 0
#with a step of -1

# for num in range(5, 0, -1):
#     print(num)
